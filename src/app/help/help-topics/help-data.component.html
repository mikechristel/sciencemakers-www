      The HistoryMakers, established in 1999, is a non-profit institution whose purpose is to record, preserve and disseminate the content of video oral history interviews
      highlighting the accomplishments of individual African Americans and African-American-led groups and movements [8]. Its aim is to provide a unique
      scholarly and educational resource for exploring African American history and culture. It is unique among collections of
      African American heritage because of its large and varied scope, with interviewees from across the United States, from a variety of
      fields, and with memories stretching from the 1890s to the present. Rather than focus on one particular part of a person’s life
      or a single subject, such as a career or participation in the civil rights movement, the interviews are life oral histories covering
      the person’s entire span of memories as well as his or her own family’s oral history.

        Interviews were first conducted in 1993, and continue to the present.  The archive continues to grow, so that queries saved today may have new results tomorrow based
        on new interviews added into the archive.  Some people in the collection may be interviewed again, so that content for a particular person may grow as well.
        All of the appropriate metadata for the interviews is shown when you drill down to a particular person or a particular story.

        The ScienceMakers is a subset of the full archive, the people who were identified as "ScienceMaker" because of their contributions to science and/or involvement in scientific practice or education.
        As the primary collection, The HistoryMakers Digital Archive, grows, so too will this ScienceMakers subset.
    </p>
    <p class="helptext">The HistoryMakers retains high-quality versions of all interviews, including this ScienceMakers subset of their corpus.  See <a href="https://www.thehistorymakers.org">The HistoryMakers main website</a> for more information.</p>
