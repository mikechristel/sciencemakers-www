<h3 class="mysubheading-gap-before">Search Syntax and Special Characters</h3>
<p class="helptext">There are special characters that add meaning to a query:  *&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;) and quotes to mark a phrase.
<p class="helptext bold">Examples of the use of special characters and their meaning:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="helptext">"chemistry professor" &mdash; matches documents with the two word phrase: chemistry professor</li>
    <li class="helptext">chemistry professor &mdash; matches documents with both words, i.e., chemistry and professor are in document (by default with no other syntactical markers, all terms must be found in the returned documents)</li>
    <li class="helptext">chemistry | professor &mdash; matches documents with one or both words, i.e., this is the least precise query</li>
    <li class="helptext">NSF + (chemistry | professor) &mdash; matches documents with NSF and at least one of chemistry or professor: + is "and", | is "or", and parentheses mark precedence
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="helptext bold">Use * as a wildcard</p>
<ul>
    <li class="helptext">chemist* &mdash; matches any word beginning with chemist, e.g., chemist or chemists or chemistry</li>
</ul>
<p class="helptext bold">Use - to start a term to negate (i.e., not search)</p>
<ul>
    <li class="helptext">chemistry -set &mdash; matches documents with chemistry and without set</li>
</ul>
<p class="helptext">As an example tying all of this together, a user looking for people's descriptions or biographies that mention chemistry and at least one of NSF or STEM
  could check the appropriate fields above, select "Chosen Fields" to the right of the query box, and issue as a query this text:</p>
<p class="helptext">chemist* + (NSF | STEM)</p>
<h3 class="mysubheading">Summary of Searching in the Digital Archive</h3>
<p class="helptext">The default search behavior is to match all terms, so the more terms you add, the more precise your query and the fewer documents will be returned.
  Search in the Digital Archive makes use of Azure Search with a Lucene-based query parser called simple query.  For details, visit the
  <a href = "https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/simple/SimpleQueryParser.html">Simple Query Parser</a>
  documentation (note: this page is outside of the Digital Archive).  In Azure Search, the simple query syntax excludes the fuzzy/slop options.</p>
<p class="helptext">Separate fields can be searched within biographies.  As with the biography results per page, i.e., people per page, setting,
  once you change the search field it remains at your choice until you change it again, so be aware if you are searching into just last names, just
  preferred names, or the "chosen" fields (i.e., the ones you checked in boxes above) as told to you by the interface.
<p class="helptext">There are two types of searches in the Digital Archive:</p>
<ol>
    <li class="helptext">"ScienceMakers", i.e., the people that were interviewed in the archive</li>
    <li class="helptext">Stories, i.e., what these people spoke about</li>
</ol>
<p class="helptext">
    From the <a routerLink="/all" routerLinkActive="active">Maker Directory</a> page, you will see a set of ScienceMakers.
    You can issue a search for ScienceMakers, i.e., within the biography details, to see a resulting set of people.
    You can also control how the results are sorted along with the page size.
</p>
<p class="helptext">From the <a routerLink="/home" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a> page, you can issue a search and see a resulting set of stories.
It has its own advanced search capability as well.
