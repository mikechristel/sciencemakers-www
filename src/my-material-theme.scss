/* NOTE: This work done February 2022 with Angular 13 and its material package.
   Advice from material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-theme used to create this file
   using the latest Sass rules.
   But, then need to get the css:
   sass src/my-material-theme.scss src/my-thmda-material-theme.css
   ...and then, need to update the styles as was done earlier per advice from accessibility experts
   (hopefully all styles named the same so that updates can be tracked easily enough....)
